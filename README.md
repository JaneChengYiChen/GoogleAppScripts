# GoogleAppScripts

# w2-echobot

### Why it come out
- My colleage once asked me how to build a simple platform to collect others needs and reply back to them.
- The idea originally came out from Excel, but google sheet has more advantage of sharing, so I chose that tool to complete my task.

### Function
- Data has been categorzied from the beginning when someone apply the google form, and has split them into sheet by year ans month. 
- Data syncing when filling the grid.
- Send mail to inform applicants when you click the checkbox.


### What I got from this project
- Learn to write google app script (My Very First time)
- Cooperated with others from different department 
- Help to organize the flow of entire tasks
- I am happy that the little cute platform can make things more effective
